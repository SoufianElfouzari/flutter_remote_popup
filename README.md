# flutter_remote_popup

**flutter_remote_popup** is a Flutter package that enables **server controlled, version aware, runtime popups** in Flutter applications.

It allows you to display important messages, maintenance notices, update warnings, or blocking alerts that are fully controlled by a backend service, without requiring an app update or redeployment.

## Features

- Server driven popup configuration  
- Runtime popup delivery without app redeploy  
- App version aware targeting  
- Blocking and non blocking popups  
- Centralized control over in app messages  
- Reusable across multiple Flutter projects  

## Use Cases

- Force update notices for outdated app versions  
- Maintenance and downtime announcements  
- Emergency or legal notices  
- Feature deprecation warnings  
- Temporary service messages  

## Why flutter_remote_popup

Traditional Flutter popups are hardcoded and require a new app release to change.  
This package moves popup logic to the backend, giving you full control after deployment.

## Status

This package is under active development.  
Documentation, examples, and extended configuration options will be added.
